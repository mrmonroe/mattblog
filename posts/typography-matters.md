# Why Typography Matters

Typography is more than just choosing fonts. It's about creating a reading experience that guides the eye and enhances understanding.

## The Impact of Good Typography

Good typography can:
- Improve readability
- Enhance user experience
- Convey professionalism
- Guide user attention

## Principles to Follow

1. **Hierarchy**: Use size and weight to create clear information hierarchy
2. **Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background
3. **Spacing**: Give text room to breathe with proper line height and margins
4. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent typography throughout your design

Typography is the foundation of good design. When done well, it becomes invisible, allowing the content to shine.
